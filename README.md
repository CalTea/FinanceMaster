To run the web app locally:

Make sure Python & Pip is installed on your system

pip install Django

pip install crispy forms

python manage.py runserver (if this doesn't work try: python3 manage.py runserver)

Note, there may be more pip installs required for the web app to run. Look for missing module messages to identify what needs to be installed.
